        This website was originally created as a personal project to save time
        on real estate auction purchases.

      <p className="about-us-text">
        Let’s face it. Currently, it's very time-consuming to search for real
        estate auctions on multiple websites every day.
      </p>
      <p className="about-us-text">
        Most auctioneer websites in the Massachusetts area are slow, dated, not
        easy to use, and hard to find. This makes the process very inefficient.
        Countless hours are wasted searching for auctions that often get
        canceled or postponed, making it even more difficult for real estate
        investors to keep up.
      </p>
      <p className="about-us-text">
        At Auction & Company, we believe your time deserves better. That’s why
        we created this website to save you countless hours and make the buying
        process more efficient and enjoyable.
      </p>
      <p className="about-us-text">
        Please note, Auction & Company is not an auctioneer. While we strive to
        provide accurate and up-to-date information, this is a personal project
        offered as a free service. As such, it is not maintained to the highest
        professional standards. Users are responsible for conducting their own
        due diligence and confirming that auctions are taking place as
        scheduled.
      </p>
      <p className="about-us-text">
        Today, Auction & Company gathers data from over 10 auctioneer websites
        in Massachusetts and displays it in one place, conveniently sorted by
        the soonest auction dates.
