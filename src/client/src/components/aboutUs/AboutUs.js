        Auction & Company started as my personal project to simplify the often
        frustrating process of searching for real estate auctions. Navigating
        multiple auctioneer websites daily can be time-consuming, especially
        when many of them are outdated, difficult to use, or hard to find.
      </p>
      <p className="about-us-text">
        As a real estate agent with over 20 years of experience and knowledge in
        software development, I created Auction & Company to provide a free
        platform that consolidates auction information from over 10 auctioneer
        websites across Massachusetts into one easy-to-use site, conveniently
        sorted by the soonest dates.
      </p>
      <p className="about-us-text">
        Itâ€™s important to note that Auction & Company is not an auctioneer, and
        while I strive to keep the platform accurate and up-to-date, this is a
        personal project. As a free service, it is not maintained to the highest
        professional standards. I recommend that all users conduct their own due
        diligence and confirm auction details independently to ensure accuracy.
      </p>
      <p className="about-us-text">
        In addition to maintaining Auction & Company, I am available to assist
        with the buying and selling process or to build websites tailored to
        your real estate needs. My goal is to save you time, make the auction
        process more accessible, and leverage my expertise to help you succeed.
      </p>
      <p className="about-us-text">
        Thank you for using Auction & Company. I hope it helps you find your
        next great investment opportunity.
