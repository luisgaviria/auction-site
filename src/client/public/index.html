      content="Bringing you all of the Massachusetts Real Estate auctions in one place so you can focus on buying. In Massachusetts, an auction is typically conducted by a licensed auctioneer who acts as an agent for the seller. The auctioneer is responsible for setting the terms of the auction, including the date, time, and location of the sale, as well as the method of bidding and the conditions of the sale.
      Before the auction, the seller must provide a public notice of the sale, which typically includes a description of the property being sold, the date, time, and location of the sale, and any other relevant information. The notice must be published in a local newspaper and posted in a public place, such as the town hall or the property itself.
      On the day of the auction, bidders must register with the auctioneer and provide proof of their identity and ability to pay for the property. Bids are typically made in person, although some auctions may also allow for online or telephone bidding.
      The property is sold to the highest bidder, who must immediately pay a deposit, usually a percentage of the purchase price. The balance of the purchase price is typically due within a certain number of days, often 30 days, after the auction.
      If the winning bidder fails to complete the purchase, the deposit is forfeited and the property may be offered for sale again. In some cases, the seller may also have the right to sue the bidder for damages.
      It's worth noting that the auction process in Massachusetts can be complex, and there are many legal and regulatory requirements that must be followed. If you're interested in participating in an auction, it's important to do your research and work with a licensed auctioneer who can guide you through the process."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
