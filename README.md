Auctomatic is designed to save a user time. Currently a real estate investor in the MA area needs to check around 15-20 auctioneer websites to choose the Auctions they will like to attend on a given day, now you can simply visit Auctomatic and see all the Auctions in one.

Auctomatic collects data from multiple different real estate auction sites and displays it all in one place sorted by the earliest auction happening at the time one visits the site.

The app is built with Node.js, node-fetch, Cheerio.js, Puppeteer and React. It utilizes google maps api to display the auctions as markers on the map.

To run the app you can use the command yarn dev  and visit http://localhost:3000/
