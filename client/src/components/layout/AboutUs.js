      <p className="about-us-text">
        This website was originally created as a personal tool to save time on the Real Estate
        auction purchases.
      </p>
      <p className="about-us-text">
        Letâ€™s face it. Currently it's very time consuming to search for Real Estate auctions on
        multiple websites everyday.
      </p>
      <p className="about-us-text">
        Most Auctioneer websites in the Massachusetts area are slow, dated, not easy to use and hard
        to find on your own and this makes the process very inefficient. Countless hours are wasted
        searching for auctions that often get cancelled or postponed making it even more difficult
        for the Real Estate investors to keep up.
      </p>
      <p className="about-us-text">
        At Auction & Company, we believe your time deserves better and that's why we created this
        website which in the long run will save you countless hours and make the buying process more
        enjoyable.
      </p>
      <p className="about-us-text">
        Today, Auction & Company gets data from over 10 Auctioneer websites in the state of
        Massachusetts which are then displayed for you on one site sorted by the soonest auctions
        happening every day.
